# For backwards compatibility, it also defines the following variables
#  CoolProp_INCLUDE_DIRS - include directory for CoolProp
#  CoolProp_LIBRARIES    - libraries to link against

# Load the cmake targets, if not already done

# For backwards compatibility, we set these variables pointing 
# to the coolprop library and include paths
