Mathcad Prime Libs
==================

These files are **_not_** part of the CoolProp open-source repository and are excluded from CoolProp's open-source [MIT License](https://github.com/CoolProp/CoolProp/blob/master/LICENSE).  They are included here, with **_express written consent from [PTC Inc.](https://www.ptc.com/en)_** (_formerly Parametric Technology Corporation_), for the sole purpose of automatically building the CoolProp Mathcad wrapper during scheduled nightly builds of CoolProp wrappers and new releases.  These CoolProp executables are automatically placed in the CoolProp Project on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/coolprop/) using CoolProp's workflows.

The files contained here are fairly static, have been binary-identical from PTC Mathcad versions 7.0 through 10.0, and should be backward and forward compatible.  However, this is not guaranteed for future releases.  Users building their own Mathcad wrappers should use their own library and companion header file supplied with their installed version of PTC Mathcad, using the CoolProp Cmake build script, and should have no need to make use of the library/header files contained here.

> NOTE: Wrappers for Legacy Mathcad are no longer built or supported by CoolProp.
