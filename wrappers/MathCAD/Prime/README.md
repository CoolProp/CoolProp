Examples
========

This Mathcad Prime file ``CoolPropFluidProperties.mcdx`` demonstrates how to use the CoolProp high-level and some low-level API calls from Mathcad Prime.  The file is saved in Prime 7.0 format so that it can be read in any versions from 7.0 onward.  There is also a PDF of the file for viewing without Mathcad Prime.


To Use
======

* Copy the CoolPropMathcadWrapper.dll file built in the parent directory or downlaoded from SourceForge to C:\\Program Files\\PTC\\Mathcad Prime ``x.0.0.0``\\Custom Functions 

* Restart Mathcad Prime.

* Open the CoolPropFluidProperties.mcdx file in Mathcad Prime; all CoolProp functions should revaluate properly.  If not, press <Ctrl>-F5 to force recalculation of the entire workbook.
