Mathcad Wrapper
***************

This wrapper is for PTC Mathcad Prime v7.0 and higher.  Files are maintained to be compatible with version 7.0, but are tested and supported on the latest available version of PTC Mathcad Prime.  Any pre-compiled binaries should run on versions 7.0 or higher.

.. note::
   Legacy Mathad (up through Mathcad 15) and Mathcad Prime 1.0 through 6.0 have been discontinued by PTC and are no longer being distributed or licensed.  Some users may still have perpetual licenses of Legacy Mathcad and are free to attempt to compile their own add-in (there is no change in the C++ source code).   The only requirement is that Legacy Mathcad must still be installed on the machine on which the new binary is being built.
