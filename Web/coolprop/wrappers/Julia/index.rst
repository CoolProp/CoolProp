.. _Julia:

*************
Julia Wrapper
*************

There are two fundamental options for interfacing Julia and CoolProp. Choose one option:

* Call the shared library directly using only Julia code (very fast!)
* Get access to all the python interface using ``PyCall`` package

Option A: Calling shared library directly
=========================================

.. warning::

    For now, only 64-bit architectures are supported.
    
Download a precompiled shared library appropriate to the computer you are using from :sfdownloads:`sourceforge <shared_library>` or the development version from :sfnightly:`the nightly snapshots <shared_library>`.  

NB: For Linux users, the file libCoolProp.so must be renamed into CoolProp.so and copied into Julia's library folder (e.g. /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/julia/)

Download the module ``CoolProp.jl`` from :sfdownloads:`sourceforge <Julia>` or the development version from :sfnightly:`the nightly snapshots <Julia>` and place in the same folder as the shared library

Usage
-----
At the console, do something like this in the folder that contains CoolProp.jl and the shared library::

    julia> import CoolProp
    
    julia> CoolProp.PropsSI("T","P",101325.0,"Q",0.0,"Water")
    373.1242958476879
    
Option B: Using PyCall package in Julia
=======================================

You must have python installed on your computer, and have CoolProp installed in your python installation.

Open julia in console and check for installed packages::
    
    # 2 required packages:
    # - PyCall            0.4.8
    # - PyPlot            1.2.9    
    julia> Pkg.status()

If required packages are not installed, use the following commands::

    julia> Pkg.add("PyCall")
    julia> Pkg.add("PyPlot")
    julia> Pkg.update()

Usage::

    # Enable PyCall package:
    julia> using PyCall

    # Import CoolProp module:
    julia> @pyimport CoolProp.CoolProp as CP

    # Call some CoolProp properties:
    julia> Tbp = CP.PropsSI("T","P",101325.0,"Q",0.0,"Water")

User-Compiled Binaries
======================

Build the 64-bit shared library for your architecture following the instructions at :ref:`shared_library`.
