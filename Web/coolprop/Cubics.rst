Cubic Equations of State

Introduction
============

CoolProp (as of version 6) comes with two standard cubic equations of state: Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) and Peng-Robinson (PR).  These two equations of state can be expressed in a common, generalized form:

.. math::

  p = \frac{RT}{v-b} + \frac{a}{(v+\Delta_1b)(v+\Delta_2b)}

where for pure fluids, a and b are not composition dependent, whereas for mixtures, they have composition dependence.

The motivations for the use of cubic EOS are twofold:

* The only required information for the EOS are :math:`T_c`, :math:`p_c`, and the acentric factor of the pure fluids
* They are much more computationally efficient (see below)

Caveats
-------

.. warning:: NOT ALL PROPERTIES ARE AVAILABLE AS INPUTS/OUTPUTS

Only a limited subset of properties are available currently. You can do:

* Flash calculations with TP, PQ, DT, QT inputs
* Calculation of mixture critical point(s)
* Calculation of some mixture flashes

Pure Fluids
===========

Usage
-----

As a user, in the :ref:`high-level interface <high_level_api>`, all that you have to do to evaluate properties using the SRK or PR backends is to change the backend name.

.. ipython::

    In [0]: import CoolProp.CoolProp as CP

    # The multi-parameter Helmholtz backend
    In [0]: CP.PropsSI("T","P",101325,"Q",0,"HEOS::Propane")

    # SRK
    In [0]: CP.PropsSI("T","P",101325,"Q",0,"SRK::Propane")

    # Peng-Robinson
    In [0]: CP.PropsSI("T","P",101325,"Q",0,"PR::Propane")

The same holds for the :ref:`low-level interface <low_level_api>`:

.. ipython::

    In [0]: import CoolProp.CoolProp as CP

    In [0]: AS = CP.AbstractState("SRK", "Propane"); AS.update(CP.QT_INPUTS, 0, 300); print(AS.p())

    In [0]: AS = CP.AbstractState("PR", "Propane"); AS.update(CP.QT_INPUTS, 0, 300); print(AS.p())

All the fluids available in CoolProp are also available through the cubic equations of state.  The fluids can be extended according to the analysis shown below

Speed
-----

The increase in speed for evaluating properties from a cubic EOS is one of the primary motivations.  Here we show an example of the speedup to VLE calculations:

.. ipython::

    In [0]: import CoolProp.CoolProp as CP

    # The multi-parameter Helmholtz backend
    In [0]: AS = CP.AbstractState("HEOS", "Propane")

    In [0]: %timeit AS.update(CP.QT_INPUTS, 0, 300)

    # The cubic SRK backend
    In [0]: AS = CP.AbstractState("SRK", "Propane")

    In [0]: %timeit AS.update(CP.QT_INPUTS, 0, 300)

And here, we run the PT flash

.. ipython::

    In [0]: import CoolProp.CoolProp as CP

    # The multi-parameter Helmholtz backend
    In [0]: AS = CP.AbstractState("HEOS", "Propane")

    In [0]: AS.specify_phase(CP.iphase_gas)

    In [0]: %timeit AS.update(CP.PT_INPUTS, 101325, 300)

    # The cubic SRK backend
    In [0]: AS = CP.AbstractState("SRK", "Propane")

    In [0]: AS.specify_phase(CP.iphase_gas)

    In [0]: %timeit AS.update(CP.PT_INPUTS, 101325, 300)

As you can see, the speed difference is quite significant

Mixtures
========

Interaction Parameters
----------------------

For mixtures, cubic EOS (and their modifications) are heavily used.  Cubic EOS allow for reasonable prediction of VLE with only one adjustable parameter, at least for reasonable mixtures.  CoolProp does not come with any values for the :math:`k_{ij}` parameter, but it is straightforward to add it yourself.

.. warning:: The ability to adjust interaction parameters is ONLY available in the :ref:`low-level interface <low_level_api>`

.. warning:: When you call ``set_binary_interaction_double``, it only applies to the given instance of the AbstractState

.. ipython::

    In [0]: import CoolProp.CoolProp as CP

    In [0]: AS = CP.AbstractState("SRK", "Methane&Ethane")

    In [0]: AS.set_mole_fractions([0.5, 0.5])

    In [0]: AS.update(CP.QT_INPUTS, 0, 120); print(AS.p())

    In [0]: AS.set_binary_interaction_double(0,1,"kij",-0.05)

    In [0]: AS.update(CP.QT_INPUTS, 0, 120); print(AS.p())

Critical Points
---------------

According to a forthcoming paper from Bell *et al.*, it is possible to calculate critical points of mixtures from cubic EOS.  For instance, here is how to calculate all the critical points (there can be more than one) that are found for an equimolar mixture of methane and ethane:

.. ipython::

    In [0]: import CoolProp.CoolProp as CP

    In [0]: AS = CP.AbstractState("SRK", "Methane&Ethane")

    In [0]: AS.set_mole_fractions([0.5, 0.5])

    In [0]: pts = AS.all_critical_points()

    In [0]: [(pt.T, pt.p, pt.rhomolar, pt.stable) for pt in pts]


Detailed Example
----------------

Here we plot phase envelopes and critical points for an equimolar methane/ethane mixture

.. plot::

    import CoolProp.CoolProp as CP
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    # Increase the starting pressure a bit, behavior at very low pressure is problematic
    CP.set_config_double(CP.PHASE_ENVELOPE_STARTING_PRESSURE_PA, 1e4)

    SRK = CP.AbstractState('SRK','Methane&Ethane')
    SRK.set_mole_fractions([0.5, 1 - 0.5])
    for kij, c in zip([0.0, 0.1],['r','b']):
        
        # Set the interaction parameter
        SRK.set_binary_interaction_double(0, 1, "kij", kij)

        # Some VLE calculations
        for p in [1e4, 1e5, 1e6]:
            SRK.update(CP.PQ_INPUTS, p, 0)
            plt.plot(SRK.T(), SRK.p(), '<', color = c)

            SRK.update(CP.PQ_INPUTS, p, 1)
            plt.plot(SRK.T(), SRK.p(), '>', color = c)

        # Phase envelope
        SRK.build_phase_envelope("")
        PE = SRK.get_phase_envelope_data()
        plt.plot(PE.T, PE.p, '-', label = '$k_{ij} = $' + str(kij), color = c)

        # Critical point
        pts = SRK.all_critical_points()
        for pt in pts:
          plt.plot(pt.T, pt.p, '*', color = c)

    plt.xlabel('Temperature [K]')
    plt.ylabel('Pressure [Pa]')
    plt.yscale('log')
    plt.legend(loc='best')
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

Adding your own fluids
======================

The cubic fluids in CoolProp are defined based on a JSON format, which could yield something like this for a **FAKE** (illustrative) fluid.  For instance if we had the file ``fake_fluid.json`` (download it here: :download:`fake_fluid.json`):

.. literalinclude:: fake_fluid.json

The JSON-formatted fluid information is validated against the `JSON schema <http://json-schema.org>`_, which can be obtained by calling the ``get_global_param_string`` function:

.. ipython:: 

    In [0]: import CoolProp.CoolProp as CP

    # Just the first bit of the schema (it's a bit large; see below for the complete schema)
    In [0]: CP.get_global_param_string("cubic_fluids_schema")[0:60]

A `JSON schema <http://json-schema.org>`_ defines the structure of the data, and places limits on the values, defines what values must be provided, etc..  There are a number of online tools that can be used to experiment with and validate JSON schemas: http://www.jsonschemavalidator.net , http://jsonschemalint.com/draft4/.

.. ipython:: 

    In [0]: import CoolProp.CoolProp as CP, json

    # Normally you would read it from a file!
    In [0]: fake_fluids = [
       ...:                   { 
       ...:                     "CAS": "000-0-00",
       ...:                     "Tc": 400.0,
       ...:                     "Tc_units": "K",
       ...:                     "acentric": 0.1,
       ...:                     "aliases": [
       ...:                     ],
       ...:                     "molemass": 0.04,
       ...:                     "molemass_units": "kg/mol", 
       ...:                     "name": "FAKEFLUID",
       ...:                     "pc": 4000000.0,
       ...:                     "pc_units": "Pa"
       ...:                   }
       ...:               ]

    # Adds fake fluid for both SRK and PR backends since they need the same parameters from the same internal library
    In [0]: CP.add_fluids_as_JSON("PR", json.dumps(fake_fluids))

    In [0]: CP.PropsSI("T","P",101325,"Q",0,"SRK::FAKEFLUID")

Complete fluid schema
---------------------

For completeness, here is the whole `JSON schema <http://json-schema.org>`_ used for the cubic backends:

.. ipython:: 

    In [0]: import CoolProp.CoolProp as CP

    In [0]: print(CP.get_global_param_string("cubic_fluids_schema"))
