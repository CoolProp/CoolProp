Release Checklist
******************

We have made a serious effort to automate the release of new binaries. Even
though things have become easier, there are still many things to remember.
Here is your new best friend, a checklist that helps you to keep track of
all the small things that have to be done when releasing a new version of
the CoolProp library. 

* **Merge Code**: Close issues and merge pull requests where appropriate.
                  Merge all relevant changes from your feature branches
                  into the *master* branch and merge *master* into
                  *release* branch.
* **Issues**: Make sure that all issues that were closed since the last
              release have either been tagged / labelled as described below
              or have a milestone attached to them. The label "invalid"
              means that the reported issue was not related to CoolProp,
              whereas "duplicate" means that the issue has been reported
              earlier. Finally, the label "wontfix" means that we do not
              consider the issue for future work and closed it. The latter
              could also apply to real bugs that we cannot fix. All of
              these issues should not be mentioned in the changelog. We
              have created a script that check the issues for you: Move
              into the ``dev/scripts`` folder and run
              ``python milestone2rst.py check v6.3.0``. This command finds
              the date of the latest release and looks at all issues that
              have been closed since then. It reports problems such as
              missing labels - you should take the time to fix all
              problems.
* **Version**: Edit CMakeLists.txt and remove all qualifiers (alpha, dev,
               ...) from the version number and update the number for the
               upcoming release.
* **Changelog**: Update the changelog and generate a list of closed GitHub
                 issues: 

    - Move into the ``dev/scripts`` folder and do ``python milestone2rst.py
      changelog vX.X.X`` where ``vX.X.X`` is the version number of the
      milestone on GitHub.
    - Copy the generated text (goes to stdout) into the changelog file in
      ``Web/coolprop/changelog.rst``. You might also use the same text for
      the annotated tag / release on GitHub.
    
* **Build Bots**: Force all buildbots to run on the *release* branch, this
                  will also change the upload folder from *binaries* to
                  *release*.
* **Release**: Wait for all bots to finish and run the release script by
               launching the ``release version`` bot with dry run disabled
               and the correct version number. This uploads binaries to
               pypi and sourceforge. Ignore the warning ``failed to set
               times on "/home/project-web/coolprop/htdocs/jscript/coolprop-latest.js"``,
               it is a symlink and will be overwritten... 
* **Clean and Tag**: If everything went well, you can proceed: 

    - Tag the release branch in your git software. It is a good idea to
      make an annotated tag and include the information on the closed
      issues here as well. 
    - Change the default download file on sourceforge to point to the new
      zipped sources.
    - Bump the version number in the CMake file and commit.
    - Announce the new features if you like...

That's all folks.
